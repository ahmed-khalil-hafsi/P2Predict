# Changelog

All notable changes to P2Predict are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [v0.5] — 2026-06

### Added
- **`--interval N` flag in `p2predict.py`** for likely-range prediction intervals (default coverage 90). Inline mode prints a labelled low/predicted/high table with plain-English framing ("the price for about 9 in 10 similar parts falls in this range"). Batch mode adds `<target>_low` and `<target>_high` columns to the output CSV.
- **`modules/intervals.py`** — split-conformal prediction intervals calibrated on the training holdout. Coverage is mathematically guaranteed under the same exchangeability assumption the rest of the metrics already rely on; no extra calibration split required. For log-target models the calibration happens in log space, yielding multiplicative intervals in price space (constant percentage width, natural for procurement data spanning multiple orders of magnitude).
- Empirical-coverage tests at 80% / 90% / 95% target rates assert the intervals actually cover the right fraction of held-out points to within ±5pp.

### Changed
- Model metadata gains a `calibration` field carrying the holdout residuals (and an `in_log_space` flag) so the user can ask for any coverage level at predict time without retraining. v0.4 and earlier models still load and predict; `--interval` refuses to run on them with a helpful message.

### Compatibility
- `p2predict_version` bumped to `v0.5`. Pipeline / preprocessor schema unchanged.

## [v0.4] — 2026-06

### Added
- **`--explain` flag in `p2predict.py`** for per-prediction SHAP attribution. Inline mode prints a full breakdown (`baseline + Σ contributions = prediction`); batch mode adds `top1_driver` / `top2_driver` / `top3_driver` columns to the output CSV.
- **`modules/explain.py`** — exact Shapley value computation. `LinearExplainer` (closed-form) for Ridge / Lasso; `TreeExplainer` with `tree_path_dependent` (exact in $O(TLD^2)$) for Random Forest / XGBoost. No KernelExplainer fallback.
- Model files now persist a **100-row background sample of `X_train`** so `LinearExplainer` can compute $E[x_i]$ at explain time without access to the original CSV.
- Redesigned **procurement-style PDF model-quality report** (`plot_results_pdf`). Three pages: provenance + headline metrics + Predicted-vs-Actual scatter / absolute %-error distribution + median error by target-value band / top-N feature importance. Restrained navy/amber palette, consistent page chrome, one-line glossary for non-ML readers.

### Changed
- **Log-target wrap switched from `log1p / expm1` to `log / exp`.** This makes SHAP's multiplicative axiom in price space hold strictly — a per-feature multiplicative factor of 1.18 now means "this feature multiplies the predicted price by 1.18". Safe because `should_log_target()` only fires when targets are strictly positive.
- PDF report titles and axis labels now follow the user's actual `target_name` instead of being hardcoded to "Procurement Price".
- The model-quality PDF now uses the true holdout (`X_test` / `y_test`) instead of `data[target]` concatenated with predictions on the full dataset — previously the "performance" plots silently leaked training data.

### Fixed
- `plot_histograms` no longer crashes on a single-column DataFrame.
- PDF `/Info` metadata is now strictly ASCII so the target name (e.g. "Revenue") appears as plain text in file properties instead of UTF-16BE hex.

### Removed
- `plot_results_html` (was dead code; nothing called it).
- `mpld3` runtime dependency (was only used by `plot_results_html`).
- `documentation/getting_started.md` (had wrong flag names, wrong feature-separator, missing every CLI option added in v0.2–v0.4; the README has accurate equivalents).

### Compatibility
- `p2predict_version` bumped to `v0.4`. v0.2 and v0.3 models still load and predict — the new `background_sample` field is optional and absent on older models. `--explain` on an older model works for tree-family models (no background needed) and errors helpfully on linear-family models.

## [v0.3] — 2026-05

### Added
- **`pytest` suite (50 tests)** covering preprocessor, log-target detection, save/load round-trip, auto-train, outlier handling, time-aware CV, CSV sanity check, evaluation metrics, feature-selection ranking, predict CLI handling of unseen categories. CI runs them on every push.
- **CLI integration tests** via `click.testing.CliRunner` covering both `p2predict_train.py` and `p2predict.py` end-to-end.
- **Outlier handling** on the target column (Tukey IQR rule) with four policies: `warn`, `drop`, `winsorize`, `keep`. New `--outliers` CLI flag.
- **Time-aware cross-validation** via `--time-column`. Chronological train/test split + `TimeSeriesSplit` for HPO. Prevents look-ahead bias on time-ordered data. Opt-in; random k-fold remains the default.
- `ROADMAP.md` laying out the path to 8/10 robustness.

### Changed
- Abort paths now exit with non-zero status code (was `raise SystemExit` with no argument → exit 0). Makes the CLIs properly scriptable.

### Fixed
- (None directly; the v0.3 cycle focused on closing test-coverage and data-honesty gaps rather than bug fixing.)

## [v0.2] — 2026-05

### Added
- **CV-based model selection** in auto-mode. `HalvingRandomSearchCV` across Ridge, Random Forest, and XGBoost picks the best model *and* hyperparameters. Auto-mode no longer hardcoded to a default Random Forest.
- **Hyperparameter tuning in expert mode actually replaces the saved model** (previously it printed scores and threw the tuned model away).
- **Automatic log-target transform** via `TransformedTargetRegressor` when the target is strictly positive and skewed (`skew(y) > 1`).
- Tree models use `OrdinalEncoder` (fast, handles high-cardinality categoricals); linear models continue to use `OneHotEncoder + StandardScaler`.
- `--budget {fast,thorough}` flag for HPO search size.
- Evaluation now reports R², MAE, RMSE, and a residual-bias check.

### Changed
- Saved-model filename in non-interactive mode now includes a timestamp (`models/<algo>_<target>_<timestamp>.model`) instead of a random-int suffix that occasionally collided.
- README repositioned as **parametric price benchmarking for engineering and procurement design trade-offs** — explicitly disambiguated from bottom-up should-cost tools. "What it is (and isn't)" section added.

### Fixed
- Feature-importance grouping no longer mis-splits names containing underscores (e.g., `weight_g` was incorrectly grouped with `weight`).
- `evaluate_model` previously ran an independent-samples t-test on `y_test` vs `predictions`. Replaced with a residual-bias check (`ttest_1samp(residuals, 0)`).
- `find_high_variation_features` no longer divides by raw `mean()` (which is undefined for symmetric / near-zero distributions); now uses `abs(mean)` with a zero-guard.
- `check_csv_sanity` no longer reads the file three times. Vectorized NA check; warns and drops NA rows instead of aborting.
- Non-interactive auto-mode saves no longer produce `None_*.model` filenames.

### Breaking
- Pipeline structure changed (new shared preprocessor, optional `TransformedTargetRegressor` wrap). **v0.1 models will not load — retrain them.** Metadata format gains a `log_target` field.
